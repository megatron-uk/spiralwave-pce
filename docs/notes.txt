String formatting
=================

Strings seems to start (or end?) with 0xFD.

Strings seem to have x and y co-ordinates. e.g.

FD 04 10 30 31 32 33 34 35 FF
|  |  |                    \
|  |  |                     - End of string
|  |  \_ Y-position of string
|  \_ X-position of string
\_ Start of string - though this could equally be the end of the last string.

The above would print 012345 at column #4 (left is 0), row #10 (top is 0). 

The value 0xF9 seems to activate the alternate font table values.
